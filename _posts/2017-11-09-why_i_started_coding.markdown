**Industry Trends**

*Finance (Robo advisors, Algo trading and Hedge funds)*

Having worked in finance the writing on the wall is clear. Robo-advisors are replacing financial advisors, hedge funds are dropping like flies and a new breed of fund is taking over quantitative and algorithmic trading funds. Large public markets are becoming more and more efficient taking away the edge that regular hedge funds had. Data analysis is the new normal in the field. Anything manual or reliant “veteran expertise” in public markets is going out the window for something data-driven and tech-enabled. The trend is only getting stronger as more data is collected on private markets.

*Management Consulting (Analytics, Cyber Security)*

Consulting a generally “soft skills” industry is moving towards tech as coding becomes a key skill. Major firms are expanding into data analytics and cybersecurity. They are the fastest growing arms of the top firms and expected to continue to be in the coming years.
With the trends seen above, there is the choice of adapt or become obsolete.



**Output/Hour and Quality of Life**

Having studied economics I learned a key principle to improving people’s standard of living.

It’s actually the Cobb Douglas Production Function. ![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function)

Cobb Douglas Production FunctionThe interesting part of this is the variable “c” total factor productivity, commonly understood to be the technological improvement aspect. Technology is the key to creating a bigger pie with the same capital and labor. It is the multiplier of the other inputs and with software, it is easily accessible.

*Investment banking VS Software Engineering*

Two high paying jobs with very different hours and quality of life, why?
Investment banks generate income from deals. Deals are done under a time crunch with a lot of hours of work for a big payout if the deal closes. To consistently produce income, bankers are constantly work late under pressure. Each deal does not build on the other and flows are not produced from the work. The only way to make more money/hour is work on bigger deals.

Software companies produce software that produces one or more revenue streams. The key difference here is that you are not working too consistently generate one-time payouts, but rather a product that will generate a stream of income whether you are working or not. Once a software is built it works 24/7 without human effort. To generate more income you add features to the product or expand your customer base etc. The main benefit is the cumulative nature of the cash flows. Work you did 2 months ago will continue to generate income today.

The flow of software lends itself to a better quality of life because you build an extension of yourself that can produce more output than any individual could.

**Personal satisfaction
**
*Output & Impact:*

Software development is satisfying because of the tangible output. Its gratifying to be able to point to something functional as a fruit of your labor. The impact you can make with software is orders of magnitude higher. You never have to repeat the same thing. If you built it once that’s all that’s needed. If you need to do similar things multiple times you just abstract your code and…

… you have it forever (or at least for a year).


*Problem-solving:*

Figuring out something you’ve been working on for a while and watching tests pass is a very satisfying feeling and the feedback is instant.

*Measurable:* 

Success of software is measurable. It functions as intended or doesn’t make it easier to assess and it rewards skill and efficiency.
